In an era where programming knowledge is widespread, starting another blog might seem 
mundane to some. However, this blog was developed as part of the creatorâ€™s journey 
through the myriad of technologies encountered in the web development landscape. The 
creator is a tenacious and self-driven individual, aware of his shortcomings, and 
constantly seeks to improve his knowledge in any field he chooses to explore.

Technologies Employed:
    - Python: Main language for implementation
    - HTML: Structure of the website
    - CSS: Styling the website
    - JavaScript: Navbar functionality
    - Bootstrap: CSS framework for reusable code
    - Flask: Web framework
    - Jinja: Template engine
    - SMTPLib: Sending contact emails

Course Utilized:
    - Python Professional Bootcamp by App Brewery
